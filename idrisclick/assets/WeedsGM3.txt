Installation
------------
To install the SoundFont, simply run "WeedsGM3.sfArk.exe" to extract the
SoundFont ("WeedsGM3.sf2") and documentation ("WeedsGM3.txt" and
"WeedsGM3.License.txt"). "WeedsGM3.sfArk.exe" is nothing but a simple
self-extracting "sfArk" archive, and using the "sfArk" utility to package the
files results in much better compression of the included SoundFont and files
than when using other archive compression utilities (such as "ACE", "RAR",
"ZIP", etc...).
